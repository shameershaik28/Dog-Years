Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways, we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. Have you ever wondered how old you would be if you were a dog?

This project provides a JavaScript application that converts your age from “human years” to “dog years”.

Project Description
This JavaScript program calculates a person's age in dog years. The conversion is based on the following rules:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

Features:
Converts age from human years to dog years.
Outputs a personalized message with the calculated dog years.

Example Calculation
For example, if you are 28 years old:

The first two years count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each subsequent year counts as 4 dog years.
Therefore, 28 human years is equivalent to 117 dog years.
